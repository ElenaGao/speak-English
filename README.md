GIt configuration 

copy `help document/Git/.gitconfig` file to your home folder, like `C:/Users/gzyit`. This configuration  file contains your identity and email address, as well as the configuration of some other functions. All Git clients will automatically search for this configuration file on your system. If the file is not found, they generate a new configuration file, which is not expected.

Git commit format

In order to quickly see what was committed, we agreed to write the commit log in the following format.

```c
new file: + filename
edit file: * filename
delete file: - filename
```
